Title of the Project
Fire Detection System Powered by Machine Learning and Image Analysis

About
In recent times, the escalating number of fire incidents poses a 
significant peril to both human life and property. In response to this pressing 
issue, our research project introduces a holistic approach to fire detection, 
employing advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. 

Features
The video processing capabilities of the camera-based fire monitoring 
system enable real-time monitoring of the designated region. A recorded 
alarm image will be sent to the administrator when the video indicates 
the presence of a fire. Based on the given alarm image, the administrator 
issues a final confirmation. In the event of a highway collision resulting 
in fire, for instance, the victims can be promptly rescued, sparing 
valuable time and minimizing damage, thanks to the image provided by 
the detecting algorithm.
